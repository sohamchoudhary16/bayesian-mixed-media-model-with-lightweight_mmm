## Situation
There is a business X that operates an online store. X pays weekly fees to advertise on seven different paid channels. Ads and campaigns in a week typically influence sales in the weeks that follow, with marketing initiatives typically not having an instant impact. As a result, it is obviously very intriguing to see how beneficial various channels are for a corporation. Think of TV, radio, billboards, and internet advertisements like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, etc. while imagining channels. So, it is possible to anticipate that different channels would target different consumers at different periods and, as a result, have quite diverse effects on future sales.
